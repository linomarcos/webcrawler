PURPOSE:
Experimental comparison of database infrastructure for building a simple
web crawler. For more details, see the blog post at
<http://www.os-scientific.org/2011/11/sqlite-vs-mongo/>

CLASS library overview:
crawler.crawler : indexes webpages as raw structured data using Mongo DB 
   instead of SQLite.
searcher_mongo.searcher : builds bipartite graph of url-word pairs from the
   database generated by crawler.crawler, and implements a simpleQuery() 
   method that returns raw search results.
searcher_sqlite.searcher : builds bipartite graph of url-word pairs as tables
   in an SQL database (instead of a Mongo DB), and implements a simpleQuery() 
   method that returns raw search results.
wordcount.wordcount : parent class for both searcher classes for setting
   stop word lists.
